# Secretary Problem
The Secretary Problem, which is a well-known problem in the field of optimal stopping theory, examines techniques for choosing the best option from a set of candidates presented in a random sequence, with the constraint that a decision must be immediately.

This repository contains simulation codes for three cases of the standard Secretary Problem:

- [no-information case](https://github.com/mcsorkun/Secretary-Problem/blob/main/NSP_simulation.ipynb) 
- [full-information case](https://github.com/mcsorkun/Secretary-Problem/blob/main/FSP_simulation.ipynb)
- [partial-information case](https://github.com/mcsorkun/Secretary-Problem/blob/main/PSP_simulation.ipynb)


The simulations has been conducted on both generated data and real data (Dutch Exam Scores) [1].
